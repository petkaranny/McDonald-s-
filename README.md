# McDonald-s-

This project analyzes the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items to identify healthy and less healthy options. Key recommendations include offering smaller portions, expanding salads and vegetable-based dishes, providing clear nutritional information, reducing sodium and added sugars, introducing more plant-based options, promoting grilling over frying, and collaborating with nutritionists. These changes can help McDonald's improve its menu's nutritional profile while maintaining taste and convenience. To replicate the findings, clone the repository, install required libraries, and run the provided scripts or notebooks.


### THANK YOU. HAPPY CODING
